# Mobile Development
Mobile Development is responsible for developing the Android App. Pengeluaranku consists of four main pages: Home, Expense, Income, and About. The Home page displays an info card showing the user's total income and expenses. The Expense and Income pages present a list of all the expense and income data, while the About page provides information about the app.

## User Flow
I have created a User Flow to illustrate the user's activities within the application. This User Flow ensures a clear and simplified app navigation. The user begins by opening the application, which leads them to the Home page. From there, the user can add their expenses by clicking the add button. They have the option to input the expense manually or by using their receipt. After adding an expense, the user is directed back to the Home page.

## User Interface
To design the User Interface, I started with low-fidelity wireframes. I created wireframes for the four main pages and two input pages for Expense and Income. Initially, I was unsure about the navigation between pages. I experimented with Drawer navigation but ultimately decided to use Bottom Navigation since the number of pages was limited.

After finalizing the Wireframe design, I proceeded to develop high-fidelity designs. I aimed to stay true to the Wireframe while adding additional details such as edit and delete buttons, an Action Dialog, and two new pages for editing Expense and Income. I also made some positioning adjustments.

## Application Development
For the application development, I utilized Android Studio as the IDE and used Kotlin as the main programming language. I also incorporated the Jetpack Compose library for this application.

## Logo
Lastly, I focused on creating the logo. I combined elements of a smartphone and a receipt to create a unique logo. I experimented with three different color styles and ultimately decided to use the middle logo design.
